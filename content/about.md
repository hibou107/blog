# This is me
My name is Nam, a programmer living in the Paris area. Programming is my passion.

I started my developer career with Visual Basic(which is a horrible language) back in 2008.

2012, I’ve got a job in the bank writing code in C++. The language is ok, but the legacy code was terrible.

2013, I’ve made a jump into Python, one of my favorite language. I could not imagine how the choice of language can improve productivity significantly

2015, After mastering python, I’ve read a question to see what I need to learn to make progress in my skill. The answer is at point number 7: Read Real World Haskell. I’ve started to learn Haskell, and I was humiliated by how little I know about programming. So the world of functional programming is opened up to me. I rediscovered Lisp, Racket, and Clojure.

2015, I decided to jump to a job to use a functional programming language. At this time, the only language I can find for a job out there is Scala, and the big data was coming like fresh air to the IT industry.

I feel fortunate to work in the IT industry because the learning process never ends. This blog is where I want to share my knowledge and try to explain some of my opinions
