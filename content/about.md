# This is me
My name is Nam. I am a programmer living in the Paris area. Programming is my passion.

I've started my developer career with Visual Basic back in 2008. This is a horrible language

2012, I've got a job in the bank writing code in C++. The language is fine, but the legacy code was bad.

2013, I've made a jump into Python, one of my favorite language. I could not imagine how the choice of language can improve significantly the productivity

2015, After mastering python, I've read a [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573135/python-progression-path-from-apprentice-to-guru) to see what I need to learn in order to make progress in my skill. And the answer is at the level 7: Read Real World Haskell. I've started to learn Haskell and I was humiliated by how little I know about programming. And the world of functional programming is opend up to me. I rediscovered Lisp, Racket and Clojure.

2015, I decided to jump to a job to use a functional programming language. At this time, the only language I can find for a job out there is Scala, and the big data was coming like a fesh air to the IT industry.

I feel very lucky to work in the IT industry because the learning process never ends. This is a place I want to share my knowledge and try to explain some of my opinions
